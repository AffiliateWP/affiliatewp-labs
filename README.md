# AffiliateWP Labs

Labs allow you to test-drive experimental, yet production-ready AffiliateWP features before they're spun out as add-ons or built in to the core plugin in a future release.

Running Labs differs from participating in a beta because we've tested features extensively to the point of being ready for use in production websites. This makes these features safe for use whether you're running a beta version or not!

Potential feature offerings could include:

1. Revamped admin screens and workflows
2. Advanced reporting vieww
3. New experimental settings
4. Other upcoming new functionality
